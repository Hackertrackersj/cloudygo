      These graphics are generated by sampled 1,000 games (no handicap, 7.5 Komi) from
      <a href="http://badukmovies.com/pro_games">baduk movies pro game collection</a>
      <br>
      then choosing 1 random position from each game yielding 1,000 positions.
      I ask Minigo for it's policy and value output at each position and compare against the result of the real game.

      The blue line is the evaluation at each model. The orange line is a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Exponential_moving_average">
        moving average</a> of the last 15 models
      <br>
      bottom graphs are simply zoomed in on last 40 models.
      <br>
      Much additional analysis has been done in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kfzXQh2oG4Fne47bcD-tyTOz8mdvDlFl#scrollTo=nyCr1p6XMaBL">Google Colab</a>.

      Unfortunately figure 3 is hard to reproduce and I haven't yet found the professional games or wrangled the outputs of the model for {{ bucket }} yet, Sorry.
